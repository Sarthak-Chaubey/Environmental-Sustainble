        <h3>A campus with a variety of sustainability initiatives often has:</h3>
        <p> <h1><b>Healthier food.</b></h1>
            <h1>Community service opportunities</h1>
            <h1>creative approach to lifestyle behaviors</h1></p>
        <h3> 7 WAYS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES</h3> <p> Here are some important aspects of environmental sustainability: 

            <!-- <h1>So, sustainability on a college campus is important, but how exactly can a college promote it to its students? Here are different ways that you can improve your college campus and make it more sustainable:</h1> -->

          <br> <br>1. BUY LOCAL:  campus can buy local foods to cut down on the distance required to transport the food. This method saves money while not adding carbon emissions to our atmosphere from the trucks that would’ve had to deliver the food. It also helps support the community around your college, which often couldn’t thrive without the business from the surrounding area. Student dorms can also be furnished with items from local shops or by buying second-hand items.
            
         <br> <br> 2. PARTICIPATE IN CAMPUS SUSTAINABILITY MONTH: The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education holds Campus Sustainability Month every year starting on October 1st. It includes varying green ideas and projects for a college to limit their environmental impact. It also focuses on engaging students in topics of sustainability like renewable energy. Many campuses already utilize this program to inspire their students to get involved with sustainable efforts on campus. Each college can participate how it wants to to ensure the best results for their community. Educational events and service projects often are included.
            
         <br> <br>3. INSTALL RECYCLING BINS: The easiest and most common way that people participate in sustainability is by recycling. Installing bins across campus makes recycling as easy as possible. Students sometimes won’t go out of their way to find a recycling bin, but if there is one nearby, they’re more likely to recycle. A way to ensure there is always easy access to recycling is by putting a bin anywhere there’s also a trash can.
         
            
         <br> <br>4 START A BIKE RENTAL PROGRAM: A bike rental program will encourage students to rent a bike to use instead of their cars during the semester. Biking can have as little as one-seventh the impact as driving a car on the environment. Bike sharing encourages those who wouldn’t normally ride a bike to use green transportation, funds other campus sustainability initiatives with the bike rental fees, reduces vehicle emissions around campus and promotes exercise and healthy living. Riding a bike is one of the most sustainable forms of local transportation since it only uses the energy produced by peddling.
            
         <br><br>5 START A CAMPUS GARDEN:A campus garden can grow organic produce, which saves money and lowers carbon emissions, but it can also directly involve the students, teaching the importance of sustainability and healthy living. You can also support the community by donating produce to local food pantries to help those in need.
            
         <br> <br>6 START A COMPOSTING PROGRAM: Food waste piles up fast, especially when you have a lot of people eating in the same place repeatedly, like a college cafeteria. Composting minimizes the amount of food that your school sends to the landfill. It can be as simple as composting food scraps from prep and waste left on plates or as extensive as using plant-based compostable tableware. To involve the students even more, it can become a competition between the years to see who has the least amount of waste. This would teach students to also be more aware of how much they put on their plate.


            
         <br> <br>7 INSTALL WATER STATIONS AROUND CAMPUS: A reusable water bottle keeps needless plastic out of landfills. Offering plenty of easily accessible refill stations promotes students to make the switch to a reusable bottle. American Dining Creations offers a water purification system that is sustainable and hassle-free. It guarantees that you’ll always have an unlimited supply of purified fresh water available. They can even personalize the system for your specific water conditions for great-tasting water. You can save anywhere from 30-70% by going bottle-free with their system. Refill stations help reduce your carbon footprint by more than 70%..</p>

            <p>Human life is possible because of the contribution of a variety of plants, insects and animal specials on land, in the air, and in the water every day. Many of the estimated 1.5 million species in the world we have never heard of, and cannot see. Yet their interaction is vital to our survival, and loss of a single species could have unpredictable impacts on the overall ecosystem. .</p>

            <h3>Pollution:</h3>
            <p>Awareness of air, water, plastic and other forms of pollution began in the 1970s and has soared in recent years. Governments in most industrialized countries have passed regulations banning air and water pollution, and mandate the recycling of plastic, glass and metal. Despite this, human environmental damage in the form of air, water, and land pollution was named again by the 650 respondents of the World Economic Forum’s leadership communities in the Global Risks Perception Survey as one of the top risks in 17th Global Risks Report in 2022 in terms of both likelihood and impact.</p>

            <h3>Drought and water scarcity:</h3>
            <p>Most of the planet is covered by water, but only 3% of the world’s water is suitable for drinking. The term “water scarcity” refers to the lack of fresh water to meet demand. Some regions, like sub-Saharan Africa, have traditionally suffered from water scarcity because of the dry climate. But now, the increasing population, changing habits (such as eating more meat), and shifting weather patterns due to global warming are all putting pressure on the world’s water resources. According to a report called “The 2021 State of Climate Services” prepared by the World Meteorological Association, in 2018, 2.3 billion people were living in countries under water stress, and 3.6 billion people faced inadequate access to water at least one month per year. By 2050, the latter is expected to be more than five billion..</p>

            <p>   When a growing world population consumes resources beyond the level at which they can naturally be replaced, the result is resource depletion. This is measured each year by Earth Overshoot Day, which falls on July 28 this year. It marks the day when humanity consumed all the biological resources that the Earth generates that year.

Only half of that is replanted, making deforestation a major environmental problem, according to the WWF. The consequences of deforestation are serious because it contributes to climate change. Forests are vital for absorbing the greenhouse gases that are heating up the planet. .</p>

The growth of IoT has resulted in improving connectivity amongst different devices worldwide. It has contributed largely to reducing energy waste by converting normal devices into smart devices, giving them the ability to collect energy data which can then be analysed to boost delivery and efficiency for environmental resilience..</p>

Although the energy needed for a single internet search or email is small, the cumulative CO2 emission rises up drastically on global internet usage. Each digital technology results in the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, Ozone, and Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which further lead to global warming.</p>

Turn off the facilities that are not needed. People tend to use online videos to fall asleep, which place unnecessary demand on data centres and harms the climate. For energy saving, sleep scheduling is used by WSNs to make sensor nodes dynamically sleep and awake as per their usage requirements..</p>
